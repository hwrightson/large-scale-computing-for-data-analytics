# large-scale-computing-for-data-analytics

This repo contains all code related to my studies on the Large Scale Computing
for Data Analytics module offered by the University of Glasgow for the academic 
year 2022/23.

I've neglected to separate work into individual folders relating to each lecture
and instead will just treat this repo as a bit of a dumping ground with 
hopefully appropriately named workbooks.
